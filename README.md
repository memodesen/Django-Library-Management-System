# Django-Library-Management-System

Django based Library Management System is a library management system that includes Html, CSS, Django, Python codes.

My goal in building this management system was to gain experience with Django while further solidifying my past knowledge of HTML, CSS and Python.As I successfully pursue this goal, I think I have a lot to learn about Django.

In this management system, first of all, as we see on the page that appears, we see features such as Admin login, registering as a student and logging in as a student.When we log in later, we see the existing books with the 'Books' section, the transactions that can be done with the 'Issue Book' and which books the members have, and the logout features with the 'Logout' section.
